# MarketObserver

The market observer provides an overview of the selected market and compares it to the list or desired items. It shows what needs to be restocked.
Main Goal is add a OAUTH2 login to the current market observer, so that the access can be limited to chosen entities and/or limit the market overview to accessible markets only.

The future Vision includes visual representation of personalized minig ledgers and corp buyback based on personalized ranking as well as updating the statics by a scheduler.

Currently the main issue is, that the API Cient, generated by the OpenAPI generator, does not provide the header information to get the "X-Pages" value for concurrent market downloads.

Nice to have:
- Beautify frontend - align frames/boxes
- Refactor frontend to have a common nav bar and allow new sub pages in the furure
- refactor to JWT?
